Files passed to # sed must be passed in the proper order. Version 1 can be entered # from the command line; version 2 can be made into an executable # Unix shell script. (Modified from a script by Rahul Dhesi.) sed '/^end/,/^begin/d' file1 file2 ... fileX | uudecode # vers. 1 sed '/^end/,/^begin/d' &#34;$@&#34; | uudecode # vers. 2 # sort paragraphs of file alphabetically. Paragraphs are separated by blank # lines. GNU sed uses \v for vertical tab, or any unique char will do. sed '/./{H;d;};x;s/\n/={NL}=/g' file | sort | sed '1s/={NL}=//;s/={NL}=/\n/g' gsed '/./{H;d};x;y/\n/\v/' file | sort | sed '1s/\v//;y/\v/\n/' # zip up each .TXT file individually, deleting the source file and # setting the name of each .ZIP file to the basename of the .TXT file # (under DOS: the &#34;dir /b&#34; switch returns bare filenames in all caps). echo @echo off >zipup.bat dir /b *.txt | sed &#34;s/^\(.*\)\.TXT/pkzip -mo \1 \1.TXT/&#34; >>zipup.bat TYPICAL USE: Sed takes one or more editing commands and applies all of them, in sequence, to each line of input. After all the commands have been applied to the first input line, that line is output and a second input line is taken for processing, and the cycle repeats. The preceding examples assume that input comes from the standard input device (i.e, the console, normally this will be piped input). One or more filenames can be appended to the command line if the input does not come from stdin. Output is sent to stdout (the screen). Thus: cat filename | sed '10q' # uses piped input sed '10q' filename # same effect, avoids a useless &#34;cat&#34; sed '10q' filename > newfile # redirects output to disk For additional syntax instructions, including the way to apply editing commands from a disk file instead of the command line, consult &#34;sed & awk, 2nd Edition,&#34; by Dale Dougherty and Arnold Robbins (O'Reilly, 1997; http://www.ora.com), &#34;UNIX Text Processing,&#34; by Dale Dougherty and Tim O'Reilly (Hayden Books, 1987) or the tutorials by Mike Arst distributed in U-SEDIT2.ZIP (many sites). To fully exploit the power of sed, one must understand &#34;regular expressions.&#34; For this, see &#34;Mastering Regular Expressions&#34; by Jeffrey Friedl (O'Reilly, 1997). The manual (&#34;man&#34;) pages on Unix systems may be helpful (try &#34;man sed&#34;, &#34;man regexp&#34;, or the subsection on regular expressions in &#34;man ed&#34;), but man pages are notoriously difficult. They are not written to teach sed use or regexps to first-time users, but as a reference text for those already acquainted with these tools. QUOTING SYNTAX: The preceding examples use single quotes ('...') instead of double quotes (&#34;...&#34;) to enclose editing commands, since sed is typically used on a Unix platform. Single quotes prevent the Unix shell from intrepreting the dollar sign ($) and backquotes (`...`), which are expanded by the shell if they are enclosed in double quotes. Users of the &#34;csh&#34; shell and derivatives will also need to quote the exclamation mark (!) with the backslash (i.e., \!) to properly run the examples listed above, even within single quotes. Versions of sed written for DOS invariably require double quotes (&#34;...&#34;) instead of single quotes to enclose editing commands. USE OF '\t' IN SED SCRIPTS: For clarity in documentation, we have used the expression '\t' to indicate a tab character (0x09) in the scripts. However, most versions of sed do not recognize the '\t' abbreviation, so when typing these scripts from the command line, you should press the TAB key instead. '\t' is supported as a regular expression metacharacter in awk, perl, and HHsed, sedmod, and GNU sed v3.02.80. VERSIONS OF SED: Versions of sed do differ, and some slight syntax variation is to be expected. In particular, most do not support the use of labels (:name) or branch instructions (b,t) within editing commands, except at the end of those commands. We have used the syntax which will be portable to most users of sed, even though the popular GNU versions of sed allow a more succinct syntax. When the reader sees a fairly long command such as this: sed -e '/AAA/b' -e '/BBB/b' -e '/CCC/b' -e d it is heartening to know that GNU sed will let you reduce it to: sed '/AAA/b;/BBB/b;/CCC/b;d' # or even sed '/AAA\|BBB\|CCC/b;d' In addition, remember that while many versions of sed accept a command like &#34;/one/ s/RE1/RE2/&#34;, some do NOT allow &#34;/one/! s/RE1/RE2/&#34;, which contains space before the 's'. Omit the space when typing the command. OPTIMIZING FOR SPEED: If execution speed needs to be increased (due to large input files or slow processors or hard disks), substitution will be executed more quickly if the &#34;find&#34; expression is specified before giving the &#34;s/.../.../&#34; instruction. Thus: sed 's/foo/bar/g' filename # standard replace command sed '/foo/ s/foo/bar/g' filename # executes more quickly sed '/foo/ s//bar/g' filename # shorthand sed syntax On line selection or deletion in which you only need to output lines from the first part of the file, a &#34;quit&#34; command (q) in the script will drastically reduce processing time for large files. Thus: sed -n '45,50p' filename # print line nos. 45-50 of a file sed -n '51q;45,50p' filename # same, but executes much faster If you have any additional scripts to contribute or if you find errors in this document, please send e-mail to the compiler. Indicate the version of sed you used, the operating system it was compiled for, and the nature of the problem. To qualify as a one-liner, the command line must be 65 characters or less.

FILE SPACING:

 # double space a file
 sed G

 # double space a file which already has blank lines in it. Output file
 # should contain no more than one blank line between lines of text.
 sed &#39;/^$/d;G&#39;

 # triple space a file
 sed &#39;G;G&#39;

 # undo double-spacing (assumes even-numbered lines are always blank)
 sed &#39;n;d&#39;

 # insert a blank line above every line which matches &#34;regex&#34;
 sed &#39;/regex/{x;p;x;}&#39;

 # insert a blank line below every line which matches &#34;regex&#34;
 sed &#39;/regex/G&#39;

 # insert a blank line above and below every line which matches &#34;regex&#34;
 sed &#39;/regex/{x;p;x;G;}&#39;

NUMBERING:

 # number each line of a file (simple left alignment). Using a tab (see
 # note on &#39;\t&#39; at end of file) instead of space will preserve margins.
 sed = filename | sed &#39;N;s/\n/\t/&#39;

 # number each line of a file (number on left, right-aligned)
 sed = filename | sed &#39;N; s/^/     /; s/ *\(.\{6,\}\)\n/\1  /&#39;

 # number each line of file, but only print numbers if line is not blank
 sed &#39;/./=&#39; filename | sed &#39;/./N; s/\n/ /&#39;

 # count lines (emulates &#34;wc -l&#34;)
 sed -n &#39;$=&#39;

TYPICAL USE: Sed takes one or more editing commands and applies all of
them, in sequence, to each line of input. After all the commands have
been applied to the first input line, that line is output and a second
input line is taken for processing, and the cycle repeats. The
preceding examples assume that input comes from the standard input
device (i.e, the console, normally this will be piped input). One or
more filenames can be appended to the command line if the input does
not come from stdin. Output is sent to stdout (the screen). Thus:

 cat filename | sed &#39;10q&#39;        # uses piped input
 sed &#39;10q&#39; filename              # same effect, avoids a useless &#34;cat&#34;
 sed &#39;10q&#39; filename &gt; newfile    # redirects output to disk

For additional syntax instructions, including the way to apply editing
commands from a disk file instead of the command line, consult &#34;sed &amp;
awk, 2nd Edition,&#34; by Dale Dougherty and Arnold Robbins (O&#39;Reilly,
1997; http://www.ora.com), &#34;UNIX Text Processing,&#34; by Dale Dougherty
and Tim O&#39;Reilly (Hayden Books, 1987) or the tutorials by Mike Arst
distributed in U-SEDIT2.ZIP (many sites). To fully exploit the power
of sed, one must understand &#34;regular expressions.&#34; For this, see
&#34;Mastering Regular Expressions&#34; by Jeffrey Friedl (O&#39;Reilly, 1997).
The manual (&#34;man&#34;) pages on Unix systems may be helpful (try &#34;man
sed&#34;, &#34;man regexp&#34;, or the subsection on regular expressions in &#34;man
ed&#34;), but man pages are notoriously difficult. They are not written to
teach sed use or regexps to first-time users, but as a reference text
for those already acquainted with these tools.

QUOTING SYNTAX: The preceding examples use single quotes (&#39;...&#39;)
instead of double quotes (&#34;...&#34;) to enclose editing commands, since
sed is typically used on a Unix platform. Single quotes prevent the
Unix shell from intrepreting the dollar sign ($) and backquotes
(`...`), which are expanded by the shell if they are enclosed in
double quotes. Users of the &#34;csh&#34; shell and derivatives will also need
to quote the exclamation mark (!) with the backslash (i.e., \!) to
properly run the examples listed above, even within single quotes.
Versions of sed written for DOS invariably require double quotes
(&#34;...&#34;) instead of single quotes to enclose editing commands.

USE OF &#39;\t&#39; IN SED SCRIPTS: For clarity in documentation, we have used
the expression &#39;\t&#39; to indicate a tab character (0x09) in the scripts.
However, most versions of sed do not recognize the &#39;\t&#39; abbreviation,
so when typing these scripts from the command line, you should press
the TAB key instead. &#39;\t&#39; is supported as a regular expression
metacharacter in awk, perl, and HHsed, sedmod, and GNU sed v3.02.80.

VERSIONS OF SED: Versions of sed do differ, and some slight syntax
variation is to be expected. In particular, most do not support the
use of labels (:name) or branch instructions (b,t) within editing
commands, except at the end of those commands. We have used the syntax
which will be portable to most users of sed, even though the popular
GNU versions of sed allow a more succinct syntax. When the reader sees
a fairly long command such as this:

   sed -e &#39;/AAA/b&#39; -e &#39;/BBB/b&#39; -e &#39;/CCC/b&#39; -e d

it is heartening to know that GNU sed will let you reduce it to:

   sed &#39;/AAA/b;/BBB/b;/CCC/b;d&#39;      # or even
   sed &#39;/AAA\|BBB\|CCC/b;d&#39;

In addition, remember that while many versions of sed accept a command
like &#34;/one/ s/RE1/RE2/&#34;, some do NOT allow &#34;/one/! s/RE1/RE2/&#34;, which
contains space before the &#39;s&#39;. Omit the space when typing the command.

OPTIMIZING FOR SPEED: If execution speed needs to be increased (due to
large input files or slow processors or hard disks), substitution will
be executed more quickly if the &#34;find&#34; expression is specified before
giving the &#34;s/.../.../&#34; instruction. Thus:

   sed &#39;s/foo/bar/g&#39; filename         # standard replace command
   sed &#39;/foo/ s/foo/bar/g&#39; filename   # executes more quickly
   sed &#39;/foo/ s//bar/g&#39; filename      # shorthand sed syntax

On line selection or deletion in which you only need to output lines
from the first part of the file, a &#34;quit&#34; command (q) in the script
will drastically reduce processing time for large files. Thus:

   sed -n &#39;45,50p&#39; filename           # print line nos. 45-50 of a file
   sed -n &#39;51q;45,50p&#39; filename       # same, but executes much faster
